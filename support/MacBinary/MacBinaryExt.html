<b>Introduction</b><p>
<p align="justify">
MacBinary is a binary (non-text) format that encodes Macintosh files so that they can be safely stored or transfered through non-Macintosh systems.  MacBinary combines the two forks of a Mac file, together with the file information (Name, Creator Application, File Type, etc) into a single binary data stream, suitable for storage on non-Mac systems.  This serves a simmilar purpose to BinHex, except that BinHex takes things even further and stores the file using only text characters, so that the file will be preserved on almost any system, and can be sent through Email or USENET News without loss or corruption.
</p>

<p align="justify">
MacBinary II is the current standard for the MacBinary format.  I have further extended the format to allow the encoding of folder hierarchies into a single MacBinary II+ file.  But be warned, currently no one else implements this extension, and it may well be that no one else ever will, so the only program you can use to decode folders stored in MacBinary II+ format is this one.  Note that this does not affect files stored in MacBinary II format, since files use the MacBinary II format without the new extensions, so any MacBinary decoder should work happily.
</p>

<b>Specification</b><p>
<p align="justify">
This is a priliminary specification of an extension to the MacBinary II 
Standard to allow MacBinary to incorporate a directory tree in a similar 
way to a unix tar file.  This is done by a fairly simple extension to 
the standard (which is documented seperately, and which you should be 
familiar with before reading this), basically, I defined a 128 byte 
block that marks the start of a folder, and another one that marks the 
end of the folder, and then set it up like this:
</p>
<pre>
start block for folder "Folder1"
  file1 - standard macbinary format
  file2
  start block for "Folder2"
    file3
  end block
end block
</pre>

<p align="justify">
While the end block doesn't actually need to contain any information, its 
format is similar to the header block for consistency.
</p>

<b>Start Block:</b><p>
<pre>
  Offset 000-version 1 - this is incomptible with previous decoders.
  Offset 001-Byte, Length of foldername (must be in the range 1-63)
  Offset 002-1 to 63 chars, foldername (only "length" bytes are significant, 
             the rest should be zero).
  Offset 065-Long Word, file type - 'fold'
  Offset 069-Long Word, file creator - $FFFFFFFF
  Offset 073-Byte, original Finder flags of folder (high byte)
  Offset 074-Byte, zero fill, must be zero for compatibility
  Offset 075-Word, folder's vertical position within its window.
  Offset 077-Word, folder's horizontal position within its window.
  Offset 079-Word, folder's window or folder ID.
  Offset 081-Byte, "Protected" flag (in low order bit).
  Offset 082-Byte, zero fill, must be zero for compatibility
  Offset 083-Long Word, Data Fork length 0
  Offset 087-Long Word, Resource Fork length 0
  Offset 091-Long Word, Folder's creation date
  Offset 095-Long Word, Folder's "last modified" date.
  Offset 099-Word, length of Get Info comment to be sent after the resource
             fork (if implemented, see below).
 *Offset 101-Byte, Finder Flags, bits 0-7. (Bits 8-15 are already in byte 73)
 *Offset 116-Long Word, Length of total files when packed files are unpacked.
             This may be zero to avoid having to preparse the folder when
             creating the MacBinary file.
 *Offset 120-Word, Length of a secondary header.  If this is non-zero,
             Skip this many bytes (rounded up to the next multiple of 128)
             This is for future expansion only, when sending files with
             MacBinary, this word should be zero.
 *Offset 122-Byte, Version number of Macbinary II - 130
 *Offset 123-Byte, Minimum MacBinary II version needed to read this file - 130
 *Offset 124-Word, CRC of previous 124 bytes
</pre>

<b>Notes</b><p>
<ul>
<li><p align="justify">
The secondary header length MAY be non-zero, and if so, the secondary 
header immediately follows the Start Block, padded to a multiple of 128 bytes 
as usual.
</p>
<li><p align="justify">
The comment length MAY be non-zero, and if so, the comment immediately 
follows the Start Block or secondary header, padded to a multiple of 128 
bytes as usual.
</p>
</ul>

<b>End Block:</b><p>
<pre>
  Offset 000-version 1 - this is incomptible with previous decoders.
  Offset 065-Long Word, file type - 'fold'
  Offset 069-Long Word, file creator - $FFFFFFFE
 *Offset 116-Long Word, Length of total files when packed files are unpacked.
             This may be zero.
 *Offset 120-Word, Length of a secondary header.  If this is non-zero,
             Skip this many bytes (rounded up to the next multiple of 128)
             This is for future expansion only, when sending files with
             MacBinary, this word should be zero.
 *Offset 122-Byte, Version number of Macbinary II - 130
 *Offset 123-Byte, Minimum MacBinary II version needed to read this file - 130
 *Offset 124-Word, CRC of previous 124 bytes
</pre>

<p align="justify"> 
<b>Note</b><br>
This block is static except for the total length field, which may be 
zero as well, in which case its totally static.
</p>

<p align="justify">
You should recognize the Start and End blocks by the version, file type and 
creator fields.  Decoders MUST NOT rely on ANY other fields in the End Block 
being valid.  Encoders MAY fill them out to look like a start block, or may 
zero-fill them.  Encoders SHOULD zero-fill any bytes not explicitly set - 
this applies to all header blocks and all padding.
</p>

All internal files should have version 0, MacBinary II version 129,129.
<p>

An extended MacBinary file MUST start with a Start Block.  Thus a 
MacBinary II+ file is either:
<br>
1) A MacBinary II file encoding a single file, OR
<br>
2) A MacBinary II+ file encoding a single folder.

<h3>Revised standard</h3>

<p align="justify">
These are the new changes to the MacBinary Standard, as generally agreed
upon in the MacBinary II Conference 6/21/87, and as changed in the followup
conference 6/28/87.  Revised 7/24/87 to reflect suggestions and clarifications
that came later, and to include all necessary information needed from the
original MacBinary standard document to implement MacBinary II.
</p>

<p align="justify"> 
The new standard will be very similar to the original MacBinary standard as
described in [MacBinary Standard].  (Reading the original standard is
recommended for a full understanding of implementation and philosophy
behind the MacBinary I and II formats.)  The binary format consists of a
128-byte header containing all the information necessary to reproduce the
document's directory entry on the receiving Macintosh; followed by the
document's Data Fork (if it has one), padded with nulls to a multiple of
128 bytes (if necessary); followed by the document's Resource Fork (again, 
padded if necessary). The lengths of these forks (either or both of which
may be zero) are contained in the header.
</p>

<b>Header format</b><p>
<pre>
  Offset 000-Byte, old version number, must be kept at zero for compatibility
  Offset 001-Byte, Length of filename (must be in the range 1-63)
  Offset 002-1 to 63 chars, filename (only "length" bytes are significant).
  Offset 065-Long Word, file type (normally expressed as four characters)
  Offset 069-Long Word, file creator (normally expressed as four characters)
  Offset 073-Byte, original Finder flags
                                 Bit 7 - Locked.
                                 Bit 6 - Invisible.
                                 Bit 5 - Bundle.
                                 Bit 4 - System.
                                 Bit 3 - Bozo.
                                 Bit 2 - Busy.
                                 Bit 1 - Changed.
                                 Bit 0 - Inited.
  Offset 074-Byte, zero fill, must be zero for compatibility
  Offset 075-Word, file's vertical position within its window.
  Offset 077-Word, file's horizontal position within its window.
  Offset 079-Word, file's window or folder ID.
  Offset 081-Byte, "Protected" flag (in low order bit).
  Offset 082-Byte, zero fill, must be zero for compatibility
  Offset 083-Long Word, Data Fork length (bytes, zero if no Data Fork).
  Offset 087-Long Word, Resource Fork length (bytes, zero if no R.F.).
  Offset 091-Long Word, File's creation date
  Offset 095-Long Word, File's "last modified" date.
  Offset 099-Word, length of Get Info comment to be sent after the resource
             fork (if implemented, see below).
 *Offset 101-Byte, Finder Flags, bits 0-7. (Bits 8-15 are already in byte 73)
 *Offset 116-Long Word, Length of total files when packed files are unpacked.
             This is only used by programs that pack and unpack on the fly,
             mimicing a standalone utility such as PackIt.  A program that is
             uploading a single file must zero this location when sending a
             file.  Programs that do not unpack/uncompress files when
             downloading may ignore this value.
 *Offset 120-Word, Length of a secondary header.  If this is non-zero,
             Skip this many bytes (rounded up to the next multiple of 128)
             This is for future expansion only, when sending files with
             MacBinary, this word should be zero.
 *Offset 122-Byte, Version number of Macbinary II that the uploading program
             is written for (the version begins at 129)
 *Offset 123-Byte, Minimum MacBinary II version needed to read this file
             (start this value at 129 129)
 *Offset 124-Word, CRC of previous 124 bytes
</pre>

* This is newly defined for MacBinary II.
<p>

<p align="justify">
All values are stored in normal 68000 order, with Most Significant Byte
appearing first then the file.  Any bytes in the header not defined above
should be set to zero.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The original MacBinary format was ammended to include the sending of the FCMT
(Get Info comment) after the resource fork was sent, if the length for such
comment, given in offset 99, is not zero.  To the best of our knowledge, no
program has implemented this feature, due to Apple's stated position that no
program should read or write these comments.  The definition remains in
MacBinary II, so that should Apple ever provide a documented way of reading and
writing these comments, terminal programs will be able to take advantage of
this feature. 
</p>

<p align="justify"> 
All Finder flags and information would be uploaded, however, a downloading
program should clear the Finder flag bits of<br>
  0 - Set if file/folder is on the desktop (Finder 5.0 and later)<br>
  1 - bFOwnAppl (used internally)<bR>
  8 - Inited (seen by Finder)<br>
  9 - Changed (used internally by Finder)<br>
 10 - Busy (copied from File System busy bit)<br>
</p>

Also, fdLocation and fdFldr should be zeroed
<p>

<p align="justify"> 
To determine if a header is a valid  MacBinary header, check bytes 0 and 74 to
be both zero.  If they are both zero, either (a) the CRC should match, which
means it is a MB II file, or (b) byte 82 is zero, which means it may be a MB I
file.  (Note that, at the current version level, byte 82 is kept zero to
maintain compatibility with MacBinary I. If at some point the MacBinary
versions change sufficiently that it is necessary to keep MacBinary I programs
from downloading these files, we can change byte 82 to non-zero.)
</p>

<p align="justify">
If the header is a MB II header, the program will check the minimum version
byte, to see if it knows enough to decode the file.  If the minimum version in
the header is greater than the version that the terminal program was written
for, it will download the file as pure XModem (creating a "TEXT" file) and
notify the user that conversion is needed because the MacBinary version was too
high.
</p>

<p align="justify"> 
If the header does NOT represent a valid MB II header, the program must at
minimum check byte 82 to be zero--if it is not zero, the file is not a MB I
file.  It is possible to write a much more robust routine, by checking the
following:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p align="justify">
Offsets 101-125, Byte, should all be 0.
</p>
<li><p align="justify">
Offset 2, Byte, (the length of the file name) should be in the range of 1-63.
</p>
<li><p align="justify">
Offsets 83 and 87, Long Word, (the length of the forks) should be in the
    range of 0-$007F FFFF.
</p>
</ul>

<p align="justify">
If any of these tests fail, the file is not a valid MacBinary file.  It may
still be desirable to distinguish between text files and foreign binary files
(for stripping line feeds or similar helpful acts).  Some tests that would
prove useful include:
<ul>
<li><p align="justify">
   A quantity of bytes in the first block with the high bit set would point to
     a binary file (though this could be fooled by files with many extended
     ascii characters, such as generated by the option key on a Mac).
</p>
<li><p align="justify">
   A large quantity of zero bytes (nulls) would also point to a binary file.
</p>
</ul>
